## 🚀 Vision: The Path to Type 1

A **Type 1 Civilization** is defined as a civilization capable of harnessing and managing the full energy potential of its home planet.

At United Earth Labs, this vision includes:

- Planet-wide energy generation and distribution  
- Deep integration of technology with human biology  
- Sustainable systems that eliminate resource scarcity  
- Expansion of human capability beyond current biological constraints  

This is not science fiction—it is treated as a long-term engineering problem.

**Current Progress:** 73%  
**Target:** 100% Type 1 Civilization

## 🎯 Core Goals

These goals represent civilization-scale milestones rather than isolated research projects.

### Cybertron Construction
Designing and building planet-scale technological infrastructure that operates as an integrated global system.

### Cyborg Technology
Developing seamless human–machine interfaces that enhance physical and cognitive abilities while preserving human identity.

### Solar Energy Harvesting
Harnessing up to **10% of the Sun’s total energy output** to sustainably power all human activity.

### Radiation as Fuel
Transforming harmful radiation into clean, usable energy sources.

### Artificial Ecosystems
Creating self-sustaining biomes capable of supporting life beyond Earth.

### Human Dreams Realized
A unifying objective: converting ambitious human ideas into functional technology through research, engineering, and iteration.
